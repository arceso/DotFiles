# Dotfiles  
My very own Linux (Debian) config files:  
**My laptop details:**

  * Resolution: 1366 x 768.

### My Openbox Usage:  
No mouse is allowed here!  
1. Dedicated workspaces:  
  * Web browser will always be on 2nd workspace.  
  * Terminals can be spawned everywhere.  
2. Move and resize windows:  
  * Meta + double tab on side arrow will resize the focused window to 100% height and 50% width from left or right   respectively.  
  * Meta + up arrow will toggle maximize status.  
  * Meta + horizontal arrow followed by Meta + vertical arrow will transform window into quarter of screen from selected   corner.  
3. Interacting with different workspaces:   
  * Meta + F-n key will move to the nth workspace.  
  * Ctrl + Meta + horizontal arrow will move the focused window along with the workspace view to the adjacent selected   workspace.  
4. Some hotkeys:  
  * Meta + t will call a (terminal) urxvt.  
  * Meta + w will call a (Web browser) google-chrome.  
  * Meta + a will call a (text editor) atom.  
  * Meta + space will invoke the openbox's menu.  
  
### Tint config:   
Made to match my urxvt theme and optimized for my laptop.  
  
### Mutt config:  
**WIP**
